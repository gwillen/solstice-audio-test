<title>"Bucket Brigade" Audio Demo</title>
<h1>"Bucket Brigade" Audio Demo</h1>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

This is a program that allows multiple people to make music together
over the internet. You can think of it like one person recording their
voice onto except tape, mailing it to the next person who adds their
voice, mailing it to the next person who has their voice, etc. Except
it's much faster than using the post!

<p>

The audio offset controls where you are in the series of people. The
larger your offset, the farther along you are in the chain, the more
people will be ahead for you to hear, and the fewer people will be
behind to hear you.  If you're with a group of people, figure out now
who will be at which position. A good place to start is people at
0, 10, 20, 30, and 40.  Numbers over 50 generally won't work.

<p>

Audio offset (seconds):
<input type=text id=audioOffset value="0">

<p>

Once everyone has an audio offset dialed in, if you're using a video
call everyone should mute yourselves and switch to using chat.  Press
<button id=startButton disabled=true>Start</button> and then <button
id=estimateLatencyButton disabled=true>Run latency
estimation</button>.  You should hear some clicks, once per second.

<p>

If you're not using headphones, the system should be able to hear the
clicks it is producing and get a good estimate of your latency.  If
you're using headphones, try to position the earpiece as close as
possible to the mouthpiece.  If that's working you should see "median
of N samples" for progressively larger N:

<p>

Client latency compensation (ms):
<input type=text id=latencyCompensationText value="0">
<span id=latencyCompensationLabel></span>
<button id=latencyCompensationApply>Set</button>

<p>

If it doesn't work, try turning up the click
volume:

<p>

Click volume: <input id=clickVolumeSlider type=range min=0 max=100
value=60>

<p>

You can also try turning up the overall volume on your computer.

<p>

If it still doesn't work, you can calibrate it manually. Each time you
hear a click, clap your hands. This won't be as accurate, but it's
still pretty good. Try to clap right on the click, and it should be
able to make a good estimate for your latency.

<p>

Once you have a good latency estimate, scroll back up and click "Stop
Latency Estimation".  Post in chat that you're calibrated and ready.

<p>

At this point the system is running, and if someone with a smaller
audio offset than you says something, you should hear it several
seconds later.  Try having a person at position zero saying something,
and have everyone else sing along.

<p>

To stop the demo, press <button id=stopButton
disabled=true>Stop</button>.

  Server audio buffer visualization:

    <li>Black bars: server's clearing window (leading bar represents "now", trailing bar is mostly meaningless except for debugging)</li>
    <li>Green bars: This client's reading window (source of our audio during previous network request)</li>
    <li>Blue bars: This client's writing window (where our audio was written during previous network request)
    <li>The buffer is circular (it wraps around). Other clients' windows are not visible here.
