<h1>Full Instructions</h1>

This is a program (<a
href="https://github.com/jeffkaufman/bucket-brigade">source code</a>)
that allows multiple people to make music together over the
internet. You can think of it like one person recording their voice
onto a cassette tape, mailing it to the next person who adds their voice,
mailing it to the next person who adds their voice, etc. Except it's
much faster than using the post!

<p>

The audio offset controls where you are in the series of people. The
larger your offset, the farther along you are in the chain, the more
people will be ahead for you to hear, and the fewer people will be
behind to hear you.  If you're with a group of people, figure out now
who will be at which position. A good place to start is people at 0,
10, 20, 30, 40, etc.  Numbers over 100 generally won't work because
the server buffer isn't large enough.  Eventually, we're planning to
tune this so delays can be much smaller.
